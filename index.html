	<h1>Die With A Smile</h1>
</head>
<p>

(Ooh, ooh)
I, I just woke up from a dream<br>
Where you and I had to say goodbye<br>
And I don't know what it all means<br>
But since I survived, I realized<br>
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow<br>
Nobody's promised tomorrow<br>
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night<br>
Like it's the last night<br>
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you<br>
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through<br>
I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile<br>
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you<br>
(Ooh, ooh)<br>
Oh, lost, lost in the words that we scream<br>
I don't even wanna do this anymore<br>
'Cause you already know what you mean to me<br>
And our love's the only war worth fighting for<br>
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow<br>
Nobody's promised tomorrow<br>
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night<br>
Like it's the last night<br>
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you<br>
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through<br>
I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile<br>
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you<br>
Right next to you<br>
Next to you<br>
Right next to you<br>
Oh-oh, oh<br>
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you<br>
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through<br>
I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile<br>
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you<br>
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you<br>
(Ooh, ooh)<br>
I'd wanna be next to you<br>
