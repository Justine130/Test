	<h1>Beautiful Day</h1>
</head>

<p>
<b>[Chorus]<br></b>
<br>
Lord, I thank you for sunshine<br>
Thank you for rain<br>
Thank you for joy<br>
Thank you for pain<br>
It's a beautiful day-ay-ay-ay-ay<br>
It's a beautiful day-ay<br>
<br>
<b>[Verse 1]<br></b>
Aye, Prinz (Lord, I thank you for sunshine)<br>
Lord, I wanna thank you for this blessing (I do)<br>
Give thanks to my family<br>
They're the reason that I ain't been stressin'<br>
'Cause it's a beautiful day-ay-ay-ay-ay<br>
It's a beautiful day-ay<br>
Yo, look (Lord, I thank you for sunshine)<br>
It's a beautiful day and I mean it (I mean it)<br>
And when the nighttime comes<br>
I give him thanks before I'm sleeping<br>
'Cause it's a beautiful day-ay-ay-ay-ay<br>
It's a beautiful day-ay<br>
Wake up, I step out of bed (I step out of bed)<br>
As I'm reading the holy scripture<br>
I told my mum I'll make her proud<br>
I'm working hard, I'll make her richer (harder, make her richer)<br>
And I have no doubt in my mind like MJ<br>
I follow that man in the mirror<br>
when I'm in need of protection<br>
He's my strength, he's my pillar<br>
He puts food on my families plate<br>
So I'm thankful for the roof I have<br>
I'm thankful for my lunch and dinner<br>
They use to hate on my ting (they hate on my ting)<br>
But they wanna call me a winner (call me a winner)<br>
I've seen people change like seasons<br>
From autumn to the winter<br>
<br>
<b>[Chorus]<br></b>
(Lord, I thank you for sunshine)<br>
Thank you for rain<br>
Thank you for joy<br>
Thank you for pain<br>
Beautiful day-ay-ay-ay-ay<br>
It's a beautiful day-ay<br>
<br>
Lord, I thank you for sunshine<br>
Lord, I wanna thank you for this blessing (I do)<br>
Give thanks to my family<br>
They're the reason that I ain't been stressin'<br>
'Cause it's a beautiful day-ay-ay-ay-ay<br>
It's a beautiful day-ay<br>
Lord, I thank you for sunshine<br>
Thank you for rain<br>
Thank you for joy<br>
Thank you for pain<br>
It's a beautiful day-ay-ay-ay-ay<br>
It's a beautiful day-ay<br>
